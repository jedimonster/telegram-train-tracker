# Telegram Train Information Bot Requirements

## Overview
A Telegram bot that allows users to query train information, check train status, and subscribe to regular train updates. The bot will be implemented in Python as a standalone script and will interface with a train data facade to retrieve information.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Train Status Queries
- **1.1** Users must be able to check the status of a future train by providing:
  - Train number/ID
  - Date of travel
  - Optional: departure station
  - Optional: arrival station
- **1.2** Users must be able to check the status of an in-flight (currently running) train by providing:
  - Train number/ID
  - Optional: departure station
  - Optional: arrival station
- **1.3** Status information should include:
  - Scheduled departure and arrival times
  - Current delay status (on time/delayed)
  - If delayed, the estimated delay time
  - Current location/last station passed (for in-flight trains)
  - Platform information (if available)

### 2. Train Subscription Service
- **2.1** Users must be able to subscribe to specific trains on a weekly cadence by providing:
  - Train number/ID
  - Day(s) of the week
  - Optional: specific time period (start date to end date)
  - Optional: notification preferences
- **2.2** The bot should automatically poll the train status at appropriate intervals for subscribed trains
- **2.3** The bot should send notifications to subscribed users when:
  - A train's status changes (e.g., from on-time to delayed)
  - A significant delay occurs (configurable threshold)
  - A train is about to depart (configurable time before departure)
  - A train arrives at its destination
- **2.4** Users must be able to view, modify, and cancel their subscriptions

### 3. User Interface and Commands
- **3.1** The bot should provide a clear, intuitive command structure:
  - `/start` - Introduction and help information
  - `/help` - List available commands and their usage
  - `/status` - Check status of a specific train
  - `/subscribe` - Subscribe to a train
  - `/mysubscriptions` - List current subscriptions
  - `/unsubscribe` - Cancel a subscription
  - `/settings` - Configure notification preferences
- **3.2** The bot should implement conversation flows for complex operations
- **3.3** The bot should provide inline keyboard options where appropriate to simplify user input

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 4. Performance
- **4.1** The bot should respond to user queries within 3 seconds
- **4.2** The bot should handle multiple concurrent users
- **4.3** The subscription polling mechanism should be optimized to minimize API calls to the train data facade

### 5. Reliability
- **5.1** The bot should be operational 24/7
- **5.2** The bot should implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **5.3** The bot should log errors and important events for troubleshooting
- **5.4** The bot should gracefully handle API failures or downtime

### 6. Security
- **6.1** The bot should implement user authentication for Telegram users
- **6.2** The bot should securely store user subscription data
- **6.3** The bot should not expose sensitive information about the train data facade

### 7. Scalability
- **7.1** The bot architecture should support scaling to handle an increasing number of users
- **7.2** The subscription database should be designed to handle a growing number of subscriptions

## Technical Specifications

### 8. Implementation
- **8.1** The bot must be written in Python
- **8.2** The bot must run as a standalone script
- **8.3** The bot must use the python-telegram-bot library (or equivalent)
- **8.4** The bot must interface with the provided train data facade
- **8.5** The bot should implement a database for storing user subscriptions (SQLite or similar)

### 9. Train Data Facade Integration
- **9.1** The bot must use the provided facade to access train data
- **9.2** The bot should implement a clean interface to the facade to allow for future changes
- **9.3** The bot should implement caching mechanisms to reduce load on the facade
- **9.4** The bot should handle facade API rate limits appropriately

### 10. Deployment and Operations
- **10.1** The bot should be deployable on standard Linux/Unix environments
- **10.2** The bot should include documentation for setup and configuration
- **10.3** The bot should support configuration via environment variables or config files
- **10.4** The bot should implement logging for operational monitoring

## Data Requirements

### 11. User Data
- **11.1** Telegram user ID
- **11.2** Subscription preferences
- **11.3** Notification settings

### 12. Subscription Data
- **12.1** Train identifiers
- **12.2** Schedule information (day of week, time)
- **12.3** Subscription start/end dates
- **12.4** Notification preferences for each subscription

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 13. Potential Extensions
- **13.1** Multi-language support
- **13.2** Integration with other messaging platforms
- **13.3** Advanced search capabilities (e.g., finding trains between stations)
- **13.4** Journey planning features
- **13.5** Disruption notifications for specific routes/stations
- **13.6** Integration with ticket purchasing systems
